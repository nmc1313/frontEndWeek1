let l1 = [1, 2, 3];
let l2 = [4, 5, 6];
let newList = [l1, l2];
console.log(JSON.stringify(newList));

//alternately, try including l1 into l2 - similar issue; l1 remains a distinct array within the other
let newl2 = [l1, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(JSON.stringify(newl2));

//Solution: use SPREAD to merge the two arrays
let finalList = [...l1, ...l2];
