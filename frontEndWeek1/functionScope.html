var age = 20; 
console.log(age);

//this will change the age variable 
age = 30; 
console.log(age);

//this will change it again
var age = 40;
console.log(40);

//to avoid a change: 
function userInfo(){
    var ageNew = 20; 
    return ageNew; 
}

console.log(userInfo());
// console.log(ageNew) would not return anything, because ageNew is a variable only defined inside the function (local scope). var is what keeps this from running - without var it will have global scope
